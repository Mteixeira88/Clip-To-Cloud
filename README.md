## What is ClipTocloud

ClipToCloud is a software that allows you to store all your copies in a customised clipboard all around your iOS devices. You only need to use the normal ⌘+C shortcut on your laptop and you can access to it on all your iOS devices.

## We take security seriously

### End to End Encryption

Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we have end-to-end encryption. When end-to-end encrypted, all your copies, folders and clipmarks are secured from falling into the wrong hands.

### How we do it?

Everytime you add a clip your clipboard, it will instantly be stored in your cloud, meaning we store all your clips with a Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) key that is stored in your main device, meaning, the device that is sharing the clipboard.

### What is Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption?

When it comes to cyber security, AES is one of those acronyms that you see popping up everywhere. That’s because it has become the global standard of encryption and it is used to keep a significant amount of our communications safe.

The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a fast and secure form of encryption that keeps prying eyes away from our data. We see it in messaging apps like WhatsApp and Signal, programs like VeraCrypt and WinZip, in a range of hardware and a variety of other technologies that we use all of the time.

### What about synced devices? How do you keep my clips safe?

When you accept a device on your main device, the devices will communicate with a private and secure connection where the encryption key is transmitted between them.

#### But wait, if the encryption key is transmitted, even using a private and secure connection, can't someone hack the system and get my encryption key?

No! When the main device shares the encryption key, shares it encrypted.

#### But how will the synced device decrypt the clips if the encryption key in encrypted?

The encryption key used to encrypt the the main encryption is stored and rotates between 4 different ClipToCloud servers, so everytime the invited device tries to access your clipboard it will get this key and uses it to decrypt all the clips.

### Why Apple devices first?

We have to start somewhere. Apple’s operating systems  showed more security than others. But don’t despair, Android, Linux and Windows are on the pipeline.

### You always have the last word

You always have to accept the device on your main device to make sure it was you who request access to your clipboard.
