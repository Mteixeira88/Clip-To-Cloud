## What is ClipTocloud

ClipToCloud is a software that allows you to store all your copies in a customised clipboard all around your iOS devices. You only need to use the normal ⌘+C shortcut on your laptop and you can access to it on all your iOS devices.

## We take security seriously

### End to End Encryption

Privacy and security is in our DNA, which is why we have end-to-end encryption. When end-to-end encrypted, all your copies, folders and clipmarks are secured from falling into the wrong hands.

### How we do it?

Everytime you add a clip your clipboard, it will instantly be stored in your cloud, meaning we store all your clips with a [AES encryption](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) that has an encryption key stored in your main device, meaning, the device that is sharing the clipboard.

### What about synced devices? How do you keep my clips safe?

When you accept a device on your main device, the devices will communicate with a private and secure connection where the encryption key is transmited between them.

#### But wait, if the encryption key is transmmited, even using a private and secure connection, can't someone hack the system and get my encryption key?

No! When the main device shares the encryption key, shares it encrypted.

#### But how will the synced device decrypt the clips if the encryption key in encrypted?

The encryption key used to encrypt the the main encryption is stored and rotates between 4 different ClipToCloud servers, so everytime the invited device tries to access your clipboard it will get this key and uses it to decrypt all the clips.

### Why Apple devices first?

We have to start somewhere. Apple’s operating systems  showed more security than others. But don’t despair, Android, Linux and Windows are on the pipeline.

### You always have the last word

You always have to accept the device on your main device to make sure it was you who request access to your clipboard.
